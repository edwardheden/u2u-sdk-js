## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is currently under a re-development effort. Not much is done at the moment.

The goals are as follows:

 * Parity with the new SDK format defined by the v2 of the Java SDK

 * Support for React Native

 * Support for Electron

 * Support for Edge, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari

 * Support for Node 10+ and Deno

 * Produce a **single** bundle for web targets but provide a `lib/` directory for Node.js targets

 * Unit test coverage proving compatibility on modern browsers and Node.js

 * End-to-end test coverage
